// ABPTS board-certified clinical specialist certifications (Strand 3 of
// docs/catalog-backlog.md, REQ-081). Ten specialties, each a separate
// proctored examination with its own published content outline on
// ABPTS's own site (specialization.apta.org), every one fetched and read
// on 2026-10-08 -- not a third-party summary.
//
// Modeling: a real, proctored, scored vendor examination that the body
// never gives an exam code -- the same shape as Google Cloud's
// certifications, so credential_basis 'vendor_exam_unpublished_code'
// (migration 016/017) and examCode left unset rather than invented.
//
// What ABPTS publishes for every specialty (exam-development and exam-
// resources pages): approximately 200 four-option multiple-choice items,
// standalone or case-based, delivered by PSI in four 50-question blocks of
// up to 90 minutes each; scaled scoring, criterion-referenced, passing
// score 500. Eligibility (minimum-requirements page): a current
// unrestricted US PT licence plus either 2,000 hours of direct patient
// care in the specialty within the last 10 years (500 of them in the last
// 3) or completion of an ABPTRFE-accredited residency within 10 years,
// plus per-specialty extras noted on each track.
//
// Weights below are the outline's own percentages. Where an outline gives
// learning-domain percentages AND a separate body-region or condition
// table (Orthopaedics, Pelvic & Women's Health, Cardiovascular &
// Pulmonary), the learning domains are the weighted units and the
// region/condition table is folded into objectives, since only one axis
// can carry the weight.
//
// Not built: Primary Care -- approved by the APTA House of Delegates in
// 2025, but its own page says the first exam "is expected to be
// administered in 2028 or 2029" and the DSP is "Coming Soon". Nothing to
// author yet; see the BLOCKED note in docs/catalog-backlog.md.
//
// Objectives are written in our own words from each outline's domains and
// condition lists -- deliberately not copied.
