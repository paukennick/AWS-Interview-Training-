// Fitness certification tracks (Strand 4 of docs/catalog-backlog.md,
// REQ-085). Five certifying bodies, six credentials, every one read on
// 2026-10-08 from the body's own current document -- not a prep-site
// summary (those disagree with each other and several still carry
// superseded blueprints):
//
// - NASM-CPT: NASM Candidate Handbook, "Updated 9/2025", Appendix A
//   (domains validated by the 2019 Job Analysis Study).
// - ACE-CPT: ACE Personal Trainer Exam Content Outline PDF (2022 role
//   delineation study; in effect since August 21, 2023 per ACE's own
//   announcement, next review on ACE's five-year cycle).
// - ACSM-CPT: ACSM Certified Personal Trainer Exam Content Outline PDF,
//   "Effective July 10, 2025" (2024 performance domains).
// - NSCA CSCS and NSCA-CPT: NSCA Certification Handbook "Effective July 1,
//   2026", Appendices F and H (detailed content outlines).
// - ISSA: ISSA's NCCA-accredited exam is the NCCPT-CPT, run by its
//   subsidiary NCCPT; NCCPT Certification Programs Candidate Handbook,
//   Appendix 2 (2020 Job Analysis Study). ISSA's own open-book course exam
//   is not NCCA-accredited and is not what this track models.
//
// Modeling: real proctored exams, none with a vendor exam code, so
// credential_basis 'vendor_exam_unpublished_code' with examCode unset,
// exactly as Google Cloud and ABPTS are handled. All sit in the existing
// Health & Fitness / Fitness subcategory (migration 007) with freshness
// overridden to certification_aligned on the track. No disclaimer gate:
// these are fitness-professional credentials, not clinical ones.
//
// Objectives are written in our own words from each outline's domains and
// task statements -- deliberately not copied.
