// Doctor of Physical Therapy entry-to-practice pathway (Strand 3 of
// docs/catalog-backlog.md, REQ-081). The academic degree structure that
// feeds the NPTE-PT licensure exam in pt.ts -- same shape as nursing's
// ADN/BSN degree-ladder tracks, not an exam itself.
//
// Structured directly on CAPTE's own "Standards and Required Elements for
// Accreditation of Physical Therapist Education Programs" -- the 2024
// standards (adopted Oct. 31, 2023; final text updated through July 28,
// 2026), read from CAPTE's PDF on 2026-10-08, not a summary. Standard 7
// (Curriculum) is the part that describes what a DPT program must teach:
// 7A (foundational and clinical sciences), 7B (ethics, values, service,
// leadership), 7C (lifelong learning, education, health care disparities)
// and 7D1-7D25 (the practice expectations every graduate must meet). The
// units below follow CAPTE's own grouping of 7D: Examination; Evaluation,
// Diagnosis, Prognosis and Plan of Care; Intervention and Management of
// Care; Health Care Activities and Community Health; Practice Management.
//
// No percentage weights: CAPTE accredits programs, it does not publish an
// exam blueprint. Units are unweighted and ordered the way the standard
// orders them, like the nursing degree tracks.
//
// Objectives are written in our own words from the standard's required
// elements -- deliberately not copied.
